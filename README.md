# Home-task-FizzBuzz
I made two files, one for printing numbers from 1 to 100 including Fizz and Buzz which are going to be replaced to the multiples of three and five.

## For runing the PHPUnit for testing
To run PHPUnit for unit testing the printing function, first of all you need to setted up PHPUnit with you PHP. However, please run below command:

```
$ phpunit fizzBuzzTests.php
```
